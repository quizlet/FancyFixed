### Usage
(Depends on Mootools 1.3.x)

Normally, just say: 
	FancyFixed.init('my-element');

However, if the element could contain Flash (common example: an ad unit), then you have to pass a second parameter `couldContainFlash`
	FancyFixed.init('fixedAd', true);
	
This is due to a 10-year-old Firefox bug (which appears to be in progress as of Aug 2011)
